	<p>Hello World! This is my first website!</p>
	<p>Hi, my name is Kyle. This is my first semester at IIT and I'm in the ITM program. Specifically, I want
	to study cyber security and digital forensics. On a more personal level, I love animals (I work as a vet tech at PAWS Chicago),
	Liverpool FC, and writing code.</p>
